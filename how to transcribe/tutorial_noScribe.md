## Transcription
noScribe is fairly self-explanatory. This tutorial will still walk you through the transcription process.
1. Open the noScribe application on the desktop.
2. By clicking the blue-folder-icon underneath "Audio file" you can select the audio you want to transcribe.
3. You should also click the blue-folder-icon underneath "Save audio as" since this gives you the chance to determine the location under which your transcription should be saved. Furthermore, make sure to save your transcription as a .txt file. That'll make further editing easier.
4. You can ignore the Start and Stop functions unless your audio for some reason is a lot longer than the dream report itself. However, as dream recordings are usually short audio files where almost all spoken words are at least somewhat relevant, setting a start and stop point for your audio is not necessary.
5. It's recommended to chose the language specifically (and not remain with the auto-option) as this can increase accuracy, so you can chose whatever language you spoke during the dream recording. As "Denglish" becomes more and more popular, you can also chose the option "multilingual". The developer himself states that this is not yet highly reliable and susceptible to errors. So this is a trade-off you can consider based on how wildy you mixed languages.
