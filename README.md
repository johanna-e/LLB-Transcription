# Lucid Lab Bern: Speech-to-text Transcription 

The Lucid Lab Bern uses Whisper (probably cite) to transcribe (and hopefully at some point translate) spoken dream recordings into written dream reports.
Different scripts are used to transcribe English (EN), German (DE) and multilingual (MIX) dream recordings and made available for transparency here.

For any questions/suggestions etc. please contact Johanna Heitmann (johanna.heitmann@students.unibe.ch), Sport Science Research Student and initiator of this project.
